# History

Tim Berners-Lee is credited with having created the initial World Wide Web (WWW) during 1985-1991, while he was a researcher at the European High-Energy Particle Physics lab at CERN (Centre Européen de Recherche Nucléaire). 

In this context, a multi-platform tool was needed to enable sharing documents between physicists and other researchers in the high energy physics community. 

Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal that was a solution for enabling such
collaboration. 

Four basic technologies were part of his proposal:

- <b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language): a language to write documents.
- <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol): a protocol to transmit resources (like HTML documents).
- <b>A WEB server</b>: a software that serves resources like HTML documents.
- <b>A WEB browser</b>: a software that acts as client to send requests and process responses for resources available on a WEB server (like HTML documents).
