# nginx

<h2>Introduction</h2>

NGINX (pronounced “engine x”) was born as a reverse proxy with minimal HTTP WEB server functions.

It addresses most of the server activities performed in the web world, such as:

- **Serving static content** (i.e. static web pages, files, etc.).
- **Dynamic content provisioning** (e.g. using FastCGI)
- **Caching content** to speed up service provisioning.
- **Load balancing** for any TCP or UDP service (e.g. HTTP requests, DNS resolution requests, etc.).
- **Securing channels** for applications not supporting HTTPS connections.

NGINX can run in several platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and MacOS. Without going into the
technical details, developers and network engineers tend to prefer **nginx over Apache as**:

- It’s easier to configure.
- It scales better in terms of resources and performance as the load increases.
- It is extremely flexible: provides load balancing, cache, web server, etc. in a single piece of software.

Debian-based distros store the nginx configuration files in the directory **/etc/nginx.**
**NOTE: if you change the configuration of the daemon you have to stop and start it to apply the changes.**

To stop nginx type:
` # /etc/init.d/nginx stop`

To start the daemon:
` # /etc/init.d/nginx start`
