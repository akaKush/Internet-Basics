# nginx

<h2>Introduction</h2>

NGINX (pronounced “engine x”) was born as a reverse proxy with minimal HTTP WEB server functions.

It addresses most of the server activities performed in the web world, such as:

- **Serving static content** (i.e. static web pages, files, etc.).
- **Dynamic content provisioning** (e.g. using FastCGI)
- **Caching content** to speed up service provisioning.
- **Load balancing** for any TCP or UDP service (e.g. HTTP requests, DNS resolution requests, etc.).
- **Securing channels** for applications not supporting HTTPS connections.

NGINX can run in several platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and MacOS. Without going into the
technical details, developers and network engineers tend to prefer **nginx over Apache as**:

- It’s easier to configure.
- It scales better in terms of resources and performance as the load increases.
- It is extremely flexible: provides load balancing, cache, web server, etc. in a single piece of software.

Debian-based distros store the nginx configuration files in the directory **/etc/nginx.**
**NOTE: if you change the configuration of the daemon you have to stop and start it to apply the changes.**

To stop nginx type:
` # /etc/init.d/nginx stop`

To start the daemon:
` # /etc/init.d/nginx start`

<h2>Virtual Hosts</h2>

A virtual Host is a web site served by the HTTP server. Each virtual host has it¡s on configuration file, which can be found at:
`/etc/nginx/conf.d` folder.

Apart we can find a list of available virtual hosts at `/etc/nginx/sites-available`

The **default** virtual host is (unless we modify it) the first configuration file, but we can also specify a virtual host by including the `default_server` keyword next to the listening port inside it's configuration file.

<h2>CGIs with nginx</h2>

CGIs are not directly supported by nginx, but we can use the `FastCGI` library to provide the CGIs functionality along with nginx.

<h2>Load Balancing</h2>

One of the most useful features of the nginx server is the capability to balance the load.

We can achieve load balancing just by creating and upstream configuration as:
```
upstream t c g i−app {
    server www1.example.com;
    server www2.example.com;
}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.example.com ;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header X −Real−IP $remote_addr ;
        proxy_set_header X −Forwarded−For $remote_addr ;
        proxy_set_header Host $host ;
        proxy_pass http://tcgi-app$request_uri;
    }
}
```

The nginx server provides several approaches to balance the traffic:
1. Round Robin: The default approach
2. Least busy: NGINX will try not to overload a busy server with excessive requests, distributing the new request to a less busy server instead.
3. Session Persistance: The clients are tied to a particular application server per session.
4. Weigths: It is also possible to asign a certain weight to a server. This is interesting when using the Round Robin approach, and we can use the `weight` parameter next to the server configuration to weight the traffic addressed to that server.
