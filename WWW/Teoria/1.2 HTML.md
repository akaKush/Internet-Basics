# HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is not a programming language like C or Java, but it is a **markup language**. This means that it is used to describe how content (text, images, etc) should be displayed *(normally in a web browser)*.

HTML files are just text files that you can edit with any editor. There are also available "HTML editors" specially designed for writing it.

<u>Let's analyze a HTML fragment:</u>

```
<html>
    <head>
    <title> Hello World</title>
    <meta http−equiv="content−type" content="text/html; charset=UTF−8">
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello <b>World</b>!!!!!!!
    </body>
</html>
```

As you can see, HTML is pure text. However some of this text is considered **hypertext** which is the text enclosed between '<' and '>'.

This hypertexts are called **HTML tags**, and they tell the browser to do something special with that text.

Some HTML tags have an opening tag and an ending tag. This is marked as <tag> ... </tag> .

Other tags however, are just composed of a single tag.

The HTML document is delimited by <html> and </html>. In addition, the HTML
document is divided in two parts:

- <head>. This part is optional. If <head> exists, it can contain several labels like <title>, <meta>, etc.
- <body>. Inside the body is where the whole HTML document is specified. All text, images, etc. are contained between <body> and </body>.

On the other hand, we can also use tags to create hyperlinks to other resources (like other HTML documents). 
This is a fundamental feature in HTML. The **hyperlink tag is <a>... </a>.**

Example from an HTML code:

```
<html>
<head>
<title> Hello World</title>
<meta http−equiv="content−type" content="text/html; charset=UTF−8">
</head>
<body>
Hello <b>World</b>!!!!!!!
Go to <a href=docs/otherdoc.html> another
document </a>
</body>
</html>
```

And you can see how it is displayed in the browser here:
