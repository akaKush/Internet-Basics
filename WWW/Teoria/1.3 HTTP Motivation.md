# HTTP Motivation

Initially, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) arised from the necessity of creating hyperlinks in HTML documents to resources that are not on the same host. 

HTTP is a text protocol and it is based on a client/server model that can
be used over a TCP/IP network to deliver virtually any resource of the World Wide Web (WWW). For now, we will consider that a resource is just an HTML document. An HTTP server or WEB server is a network daemon that uses
by default the well-known TCP port 80. HTTP clients, generically called WEB Browsers (e.g. firefox or lynx), send HTTP requests to the HTTP servers asking for a resource and the server responds with the requested resource.
