# URL / URI

The first issue to implement HTTP is to define **how to identify resources.**

The identifiers used in HTTP were initially defined by Tim Berners in 1991. They were called URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and they were first used
to allow authors of HTML documents to establish hyperlinks in the WWW. 

An URL is just a text string with a standard format that allows you to name a resource based on its location on the WWW. In 1994, the URL concept
was incorporated into a more general concept called URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). 

URI is the standard name for resource identifiers in the Internet, but the term URL is still widely used. The simplest URL/URI format is as follows:

`protocol :// hostname / directory / resource`

But other informatio can als be present in the URL:

`protocol :// username : password@hostname : port / directory / resource`



_Important note:_ If in the URL there is not any resource (filename) specified, it is assumed that the client is asking for a file called **index.html** or **index.htm**. 
As its name suggests, this file contains an HTML file with the Web site index.

On the other hand, we can use absolute or relative paths in HTTP hyperlinks. In an HTTP server, absolute paths are related to a directory called DocumentRoot. 
This parameter is defined in the configuration file of the HTTP server. 
For example, a typical DocumentRoot when using Linux is **/var/www**. In this case, the URL http://www.example.com/images/upc1.gif refers to a file called upc1.gif that is stored in the HTTP server in the directory /var/www/images.

We can see the difference between absolute and relative paths in the following piece of code:

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title> Hello World</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello <b>World</b>!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>Go to <a href=docs/otherdoc.html> another document </a></p>
        <p>You can visit the UPC home page at <a href="http://www.upc.edu">UPC home</a>. </p>
        <img src="/images/upc1.gif">
        <img src="/images/upc2.gif">
        <img src="http://www.example.com/images/upc1.gif">
    </body>
</html>
```
