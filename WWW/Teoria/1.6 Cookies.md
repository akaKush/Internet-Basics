# Cookies

As we explained previously, HTTP is a **stateless** protocol.

A **cookie** is a piece of information (UTF8 text) sent from an HTTP server and that is stored by the browser in the client's filesystem.
Sometimes cookies are also called "footprints".
These cookies provide a state (memory of previous events) into otherwise statless HTTP transactions.

Without cookies, **each retreival** of a webpage, or even a single component, is an **isolated event**.

The most common uses of cookies are:

- User Control (For ex: when a user enters his username and pwd, a cookie can store this information so there is no need to enter them again in a later visit to the web server).
- Getting information about user's browsing habits.


*How do cookies work?*

The HTTP server sends lines with the **Set-Cookie header** if the server wishes the browser to store these cookies.
Set-Cookie is a directive for the browser to store the cookie and send it back in future requests to the server (subject to expiration time or other cookie attributes).

Let's see a visual example:

We can describe the process going on in the above picture:
1. The client sends a regular request.
2. The server asks the client to store that cookie.
3. The client sends the cookie in a subsequent request, when it is needed.


It is worth knowing that the cookies do have more fields, like path and domain, which help in deciding when to send it or not.

As you can imagine, cookies can cause (and are actually causing) privacy problems.
