# HTTP Proxies

An HTTP **proxy** is a program that acts as an **intermediary between a browser and a Web Server**.

HTTP proxies are commonly used for *security* (a single point of control) and *efficiency* (caching).

There are two basic types of proxies (from users point of view):

- **Tranparent**: A transparent proxy intercepts normal communication at the network layer without requiring any special client configuration. Clients do not need to be aware of this proxy existence.
- **Non Tranparent**: This types of proxies receive requests frrom the clients and sends the requests to the servers. The responses go the same way back also using the proxy. Therefore, a proxy must have functions of either client & server. A non-tranparent proxy can use another transparent or non-transparent proxy to reach the final server.


Clients send their requests to the proxy instead of the real server specified in the URL. <-- *The proxy IP address and port is defined in thr browser*

HTTP requests using a non-transparent proxy must include the full URL of the resource (not only relative path), as the proxy has to know which server it must send the HTTP request.
A request using a non-transparent proxy would be something like this:

```
GET http://www.somehost.com/path/file.html HTTP/1.0
[blank line]
```

Lastly, it is nice to know there are many Open Source Proxies used widely.
