# Dynamic Web

<h2>Introduction</h2>

In today's Web, the content is not static, but documents are generated on the fly by servers with information provided by clients.
As a result, WWW is not a huge database of documents, but a platform to implement services & applications. 

Common applications of the dynamic web are searching engines, remote access to corporate applications and databases, etc.

<h2>CGIs</h2>

*Note: We do have several ways of implementing the dynamic Web. In this document, we will only explain CGIs, as they are easier to understand, and they were the first methiçod used for that specific purpose.*

**CGIs** or **Common Gateway Interfaces** are a standard procedure through which HTTP servers can use external applications to dynamically generate content.

When we want to use a CGI, in the URL we must identify:

- An executable program (the CGI itself)
- The parameters with which the CGI has to be executed

However, when we use CGIs we find some issues we need to solve.

The first one is how a web server knows that is has to execute a program instead of sending a resource. --> A usual solution is to store all the CGIs in a special directory, typically called /cgi-bin/. In this way, if a client asks for *www.examplecom/cgi-bin/program* the server knows that it must execute *program* instead of sending it.

The second is how to send the parameters to the *program*. When we use GET, the parameters are encoded in the URL. These parameters are added to the URL after a **"?"** character, and separated by the character **"&"**.

Example:
`http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/program?param1=value1&param2=value2...`

*Note: Spaces are translated into the '+' character, and ASCII characters can also be sent in the %NNN format*.

Finally, before executing the CGI, the Web server establishes a special context for the *program* using environment variables, to ensure a correct execution of it.
These variables are:
**CONTENT_LENGTH, CONTENT_TYPE, REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_USER, REQUEST_METHOD, SERVER_NAME, QUERY_STRING, GATEWAY_INTERFACE, HTTP_'VERSION'**

For GET requests, the QUERY_STRING variable takes the value of the parameters and the CGI can use them as the client has specified.
For the response, the CGI writes it to the **STDOUT**. Then the server reads this answer and sends it to the client through the socket.

Depending on the type of web server, the CGI application can act in two different ways:

- NPH Server (No Parse Headers) --> The CGI writes the complete response including the HTTP headers.
- PH Servers (Pare Headers) --> The CGI writes the complete response without the HTTP headers, and it mus pass information on how to form them.

The most common web servers are NPH.

Finally, it should be remarked that CGIs are not the most efficient solution because **a process is created per request**, and nowadays there are too many requests to be handled in this way.

Today's more efficient solutions to create dynamic websites are languages like Javascript, Python, PHP, Java servlets, etc.

<h2>Other (common) methods in Requests: HEAD and POST</h2>

- The **HEAD** method is used when we want a response only with the status line and headers (without a body).
*HEAD is useful when the resources from the server are not actually needed. This can be the case in which we need to make some tests but we do not want to download a resource (which can be heavy)*

- The **POST** request is used for dynamic Web. The difference between POST and GET is that POST requests use the body of the request to send parameters instead of coding the parameters directly into the URL.
*CGIs with POST use the STDIN to receive the request body (program's parameters) instead of using the QUERY_STRING variable*

<h2>HTML Forms</h2>

An HTML form _allows a client to send parameters to a WEB server_.

The tag to declare a form is **<form> ... </form>** where different elements can be inserted inside, like text input elements, codes, images, checkboxes...
These elements are inserted into the form using the tag **INPUT**. All items of the form have a "type" attribute and they might have a "name" attribute.

There are 2 special elements in forms: RESET, which clears the form to its initial state, and SUBMIT, which presents a button to send the form to the server.

Example of an HTML form, and how it is displayed in the browser:

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title> Website title </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Form to select parametres to send to the server.
        <form ACTION="/cgi−bin/process" METHOD="GET">
            Enter a name: <INPUT NAME="a" TYPE="text"> <br>
            Enter a password: <INPUT TYPE="password" NAME="b" MAXLENGHT="8"> <br>
            Checkbox: <INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="c"> <br>
            <INPUT TYPE="reset"> <INPUT TYPE="submit">
        <br>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```
<img src="https://github.com/akaKush/Internet-Basics/blob/main/WWW/Teoria/Pictures/form.png"/>

When the form is submitted, the client generates an HTTP request using the method showed in the METHOD attribute (GET or POST), to execute the script or application indicated in the ACTION attribute.

The most common question regarding Dynamic Web is: **Should I use GET or POST?**

Each method has its advantages and drawbacks. 

**GET**
When using GET, the parameters are encoded in the URL. This can be useful in many cases, but if we want to protect some sensible information, the GET method could cause security vulnerabilities, because the parameters will be shown to everyone in the URL.
Another drawback of GET is that it does not allow to send binary files in the body of
